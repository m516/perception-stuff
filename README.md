# Computer Perception Stuff

In the words of Louis Armstrong:
> I see trees of green, red roses too.
> I see them bloom for me and you.
> And I think to myself
> What a wonderful world.

At the risk of losing the deep, powerful, touching meaning of this piece, I'd like to raise some questions I find amusing to think about:
* How do we judge that trees are green and the roses are red?
* With perceptions like these over time, how do we assess the world for properties like wonder?
* How can we emulate these processes on a machine?

In response, I'd like to share the results of my obsessive analysis in a set of self-contained, interactive examples. It is by no means exhaustive, comprehensive, or definitive, but I hope the curious and like-minded can find interesting patterns in here to gain a sense awe and appreciation for the beauty of structure in this wonderful world.

This project is intended as a learning platform for high-school students interested in developing high-speed computer vision based tools that are unavailable on LimeLights, but I hope to expand into other kinds of computational perception later.

Imagine this project as something like Evan Chen's [Infinitely Large Napkin](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html), where a practically indefinite amount of space and time is available at my disposal to attempt to address as many computational perception questions as I can.

## Getting started

Every topic in this project is assigned a little module I call a Sketch. As a general rule, each Sketch is a folder containing source code in C++ and build scripts for an executable.

Don't follow any instructions you don't agree with. Source code and instructions are meant to generally follow industry standards, but they're optimized for readability and compatability, not necessarily safety or speed.

Sketches are grouped in four categories:
00. Setup - how to start developing, building, and running a sketch, given access to a PC.
01. Language - how to translate basic ideas into code.
02. Theory - techniques for processing data.
03. Tools - how to use popular libraries.
04. Public-Sketches - putting multiple tools together to make more interesting things.
99. My-Sketches - a place for your projects.
