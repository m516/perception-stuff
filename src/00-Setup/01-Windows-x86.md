# Setup (Windows)

To use this project to its full potential we'll need:
* a C++ compiler ([GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/))
* the build system ([CMake](https://cmake.org/))
* version control ([Git](https://git-scm.com/))
* (optionally) an IDE ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
* (optionally) a development environment/installer that doesn't require admin priviliges ([Scoop](https://scoop.sh/))

The rest of the instructions have been generated by [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app). While I've reviewed each of the tools and trust them on my devices, I can't guarantee their safety. Double-check any instructions and setup scripts and seek permission from your device administrator before continuing.

#### **Phase 1: The One-Time Setup**

We will use PowerShell (the default Windows terminal) to install the tools.

1. Press the **Windows Key** and type `PowerShell`.
2. Click on **Windows PowerShell** (do *not* run as Administrator).
3. Copy and paste the following command to allow local scripts to run (this is a user-level setting and is safe):
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

```


*If it asks for confirmation, type `Y` and press Enter.*
4. Now, install the **Scoop** package manager by pasting this command:
```powershell
irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```


*Wait for it to say "Scoop was installed successfully!"*

#### **Phase 2: Install the Software Stack**

Now we will install everything you need with a single command. This includes:

* **Git:** To download and contribute to the code.
* **GCC:** The C++ Compiler (MinGW-w64).
* **CMake:** The build system used to organize the project.
* **Ninja:** A tool that makes CMake builds run very fast.
* **VS Code:** The code editor.

1. In the same PowerShell window, copy and paste this command:
```powershell
scoop install git gcc cmake ninja vscode

```


*Note: This may take a few minutes as it downloads and installs the tools. If it asks to install "7zip" or other dependencies, allow it.*
2. Once finished, verify everything is working by typing:
```powershell
g++ --version
cmake --version

```


*You should see version numbers for both.*

#### **Phase 3: Configure Visual Studio Code**

1. Open **VS Code** (you can type `code` in PowerShell or find it in your Start Menu).
2. On the left sidebar, click the **Extensions** icon (it looks like four squares).
3. Search for and install the following two extensions:
* **C/C++ Extension Pack** (by Microsoft)
* **CMake Tools** (by Microsoft)



#### **Phase 4: Cloning and Building the Project**

1. **Get the Code:**
* In VS Code, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette.
* Type `Git: Clone` and press Enter.
* Paste the GitHub URL of the project: `https://github.com/m516/perception-stuff.git`
* Select a folder to save it in (e.g., your Documents folder).


2. **Configure CMake:**
* Once the folder opens, VS Code should detect it is a CMake project.
* You might see a popup asking to "Configure project". Click **Yes**.
* If it asks to **"Select a Kit"**, look for the option that mentions **GCC** (e.g., *GCC 12.x.x x86_64-w64-mingw32*). Select that one.
* *Note: Do not select "Visual Studio Community" or "cl.exe" as you do not have those installed.*


3. **Build:**
* Look at the blue/purple status bar at the very bottom of the VS Code window.
* Click the **Build** button (or the Gear icon), or press `F7`.
* The output terminal should show the project compiling.
