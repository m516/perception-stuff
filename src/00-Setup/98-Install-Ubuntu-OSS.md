# Setup (Ubuntu)

Not many people recognize the value of open source software, so I assume you have some experience navigating a terminal. Here's my setup.

The rest of the instructions have been generated by [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app). While I've reviewed each of the tools and trust them on my devices, I can't guarantee their safety. Double-check any instructions and setup scripts and seek permission from your device administrator before continuing.

This guide covers the installation of **VSCodium** (the Free/Libre Open Source Software binary of VS Code), **CMake**, and standard **C++ build tools** on a modern Ubuntu Desktop (22.04 / 24.04).

## Prerequisites

Open your terminal (`Ctrl`+`Alt`+`T`) and ensure your package lists are up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

```

---

## 1. Install C++ Compiler & Build Tools

We will install `build-essential` (which includes GCC/G++ and Make), `gdb` (debugger), and `cmake`.

1. **Install the packages:**
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential gdb cmake -y

```


2. **Verify installations:**
```bash
gcc --version
g++ --version
cmake --version
```

## 2. Install VSCodium

VSCodium is not in the default Ubuntu repositories. We will add the official VSCodium repository to receive updates automatically.

1. **Add the GPG key:**
```bash
wget -qO - [https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg](https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg) | gpg --dearmor | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg

```


2. **Add the repository:**
```bash
echo 'deb [ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg ] [https://download.vscodium.com/debs](https://download.vscodium.com/debs) vscodium main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list

```


3. **Update and Install:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install codium -y

```

## 3. Install Recommended Extensions

Because VSCodium uses the **Open VSX Registry** (not the Microsoft Marketplace), and because the Microsoft C/C++ extension license restricts its use to official Visual Studio products, we recommend the following open-source stack for the best experience.

Open VSCodium and install these extensions via the Extensions view (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`X`):

### A. IntelliSense & Code Navigation: **clangd**

* **ID:** `llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd`
* **Why:** Provides superior code completion and navigation compared to the default engine. It is faster and fully open source.

### B. Build System: **CMake Tools**

* **ID:** `ms-vscode.cmake-tools` (or compatible fork)
* **Why:** Provides a status bar for configuring CMake projects, selecting kits (compilers), and building targets with one click.

### C. Debugging: **CodeLLDB**

* **ID:** `vadimcn.vscode-lldb`
* **Why:** The standard Microsoft C++ debugger is license-locked. CodeLLDB is a native, high-performance debugger based on LLDB that works perfectly with VSCodium.

### Why this specific stack?

You might notice I recommended **clangd** and **CodeLLDB** instead of the "Standard" Microsoft C/C++ extension. Here is why this is important for VSCodium:

1.  **Licensing:** The Microsoft C/C++ extension's license **explicitly prohibits** its use on non-Microsoft products. Installing it on VSCodium technically violates their EULA.
2.  **Performance:** `clangd` is generally faster, lighter, and more accurate for modern C++ standards than the Microsoft IntelliSense engine.
3.  **Debugging:** Since the MS debugger binary will often refuse to run on Codium, `CodeLLDB` is the required alternative for setting breakpoints and inspecting variables.
