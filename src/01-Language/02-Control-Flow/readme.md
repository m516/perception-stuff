# Project 01-02: Control Flow

In the previous sketches, our code executed line-by-line, from top to bottom. This is great for simple calculations, but most programs need to make decisions or repeat tasks. This is called **Control Flow**.

We explore the five most common control flow structures in C++:

1.  **If / Else**: Execute code only if a condition is true.
2.  **While**: Repeat code as long as a condition is true.
3.  **Do / While**: Repeat code, but guarantee it runs at least once.
4.  **For**: A compact loop, perfect for iterating a specific number of times.
5.  **Switch**: Select one path from many based on a value.
